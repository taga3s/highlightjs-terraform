# Highlightjs-Terraform (maintained fork)

This is a maintained fork of https://github.com/highlightjs/highlightjs-terraform. I started this fork because the original repository was not being maintained for a long time, but it is still a very useful library for syntax highlighting Terraform code in web applications using Highlight.js.

## Usage

1. Install with npm, pnpm, or yarn:

```bash
$ npm install @taga3s/highlightjs-terraform
```

2. Use `.css` files of highlight.js in your project
